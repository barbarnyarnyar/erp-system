# Epic: Inventory Management

*   **As an Operations Manager,** I want to view real-time inventory levels for all products **so that** I can make informed decisions about stock control.
    *   **AC 1:** The system shows quantity on hand, quantity reserved, and quantity available.
    *   **AC 2:** I can view stock levels across multiple warehouse locations.
    *   **AC 3:** The system automatically updates stock levels when a sale or purchase is made.

*   **As a Warehouse Manager,** I want the system to automatically suggest reorder points for products **so that** we can avoid stockouts.
    *   **AC 1:** The system calculates a suggested reorder point based on historical sales data and lead times.
    *   **AC 2:** I receive an alert when a product's stock level drops to its reorder point.
    *   **AC 3:** I can manually override the suggested reorder point for any product.
