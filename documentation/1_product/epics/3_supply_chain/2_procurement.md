# Epic: Procurement

*   **As an Operations Manager,** I want to create and send purchase orders to vendors **so that** I can formally request and track incoming inventory.
    *   **AC 1:** I can select a vendor and add products to the PO from the product catalog.
    *   **AC 2:** The system pre-fills the cost based on the vendor agreement.
    *   **AC 3:** The PO can be emailed to the vendor directly from the system.

*   **As a Warehouse Worker,** I want to record the receipt of goods against a purchase order **so that** inventory levels are updated accurately.
    *   **AC 1:** I can scan product barcodes to receive items.
    *   **AC 2:** I can record partial receipts if the full order doesn't arrive.
    *   **AC 3:** The system flags any discrepancies between the PO and the received quantity.
