# Epic: General Ledger Management

*   **As a Finance Manager,** I want to manage a flexible Chart of Accounts **so that** I can structure our finances according to business needs.
    *   **AC 1:** I can create, edit, and deactivate GL accounts.
    *   **AC 2:** I can define account hierarchies (parent-child relationships).
    *   **AC 3:** The system prevents deletion of accounts with transaction history.

*   **As an Accountant,** I want to post manual journal entries **so that** I can make adjustments, accruals, and corrections.
    *   **AC 1:** A journal entry must have at least two lines (debit and credit).
    *   **AC 2:** The total debits must equal total credits for the entry to be valid.
    *   **AC 3:** I can attach supporting documents to a journal entry.
