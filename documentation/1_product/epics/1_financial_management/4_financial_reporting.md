# Epic: Financial Reporting

*   **As a Business Owner,** I want to view a real-time Profit & Loss statement **so that** I can understand our company's financial performance at a glance.
    *   **AC 1:** The report can be filtered by date range (month, quarter, year).
    *   **AC 2:** The report shows revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, expenses, and net income.
    *   **AC 3:** I can drill down from a summary account to see the individual transactions.
