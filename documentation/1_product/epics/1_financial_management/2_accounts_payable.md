# Epic: Accounts Payable (AP)

*   **As an Accountant,** I want to manage vendor profiles **so that** I have a central record of supplier information.
    *   **AC 1:** I can add new vendors with details like name, address, tax ID, and payment terms.
    *   **AC 2:** I can view the complete transaction history for any vendor.
    *   **AC 3:** I can deactivate vendors we no longer work with.

*   **As an Accountant,** I want to process vendor bills by matching them to purchase orders **so that** we only pay for what we ordered and received.
    *   **AC 1:** The system allows matching a bill to one or more POs.
    *   **AC 2:** The system flags discrepancies in quantity or price between the bill and the PO.
    *   **AC 3:** I can approve a bill for payment once it's successfully matched.
