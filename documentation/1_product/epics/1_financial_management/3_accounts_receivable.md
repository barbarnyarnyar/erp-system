# Epic: Accounts Receivable (AR)

*   **As a Finance Manager,** I want to generate and send customer invoices **so that** we can bill for products and services rendered.
    *   **AC 1:** Invoices can be created automatically from sales orders or manually.
    *   **AC 2:** Invoices can be sent to customers via email as a PDF attachment.
    *   **AC 3:** The system tracks the status of each invoice (draft, sent, paid, overdue).

*   **As an Accountant,** I want to record customer payments against invoices **so that** we can keep our receivables up to date.
    *   **AC 1:** I can apply a single payment to multiple invoices.
    *   **AC 2:** I can record partial payments.
    *   **AC 3:** The system automatically updates the invoice status and customer balance.
