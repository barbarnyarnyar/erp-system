# Epic: Sales Pipeline Management

*   **As a Salesperson,** I want to manage my sales opportunities in a pipeline view **so that** I can track my deals and prioritize my efforts.
    *   **AC 1:** I can move opportunities through customizable stages (e.g., Prospecting, Proposal, Negotiation).
    *   **AC 2:** Each opportunity tracks the potential deal value and estimated close date.
    *   **AC 3:** The system provides a forecast of my expected sales for the quarter.

*   **As a Salesperson,** I want to generate quotes for potential customers **so that** I can provide them with a formal offer.
    *   **AC 1:** I can add products from the catalog to the quote.
    *   **AC 2:** I can apply discounts and view the final price and margin.
    *   **AC 3:** I can convert a quote into a sales order with one click if the customer accepts.
