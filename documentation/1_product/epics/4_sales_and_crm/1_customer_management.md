# Epic: Customer Management

*   **As a Sales Manager,** I want a 360-degree view of each customer **so that** my team has all the context they need for interactions.
    *   **AC 1:** The customer view shows contact details, communication history, and past orders.
    *   **AC 2:** I can add notes and log calls, meetings, and emails.
    *   **AC 3:** The system links to all related sales orders, invoices, and support tickets.
