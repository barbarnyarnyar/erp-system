# Epic: Employee Data Management

*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to maintain a central profile for each employee **so that** all employee information is stored securely and accessibly.
    *   **AC 1:** The profile includes personal details, contact info, job role, salary, and emergency contacts.
    *   **AC 2:** I can upload and store documents like contracts and performance reviews.
    *   **AC 3:** Access to sensitive information is restricted based on user roles.

*   **As an Employee,** I want to access a self-service portal **so that** I can view and update my own personal information.
    *   **AC 1:** I can update my address and phone number.
    *   **AC 2:** I can view my payslips and tax documents.
    *   **AC 3:** I can view my remaining leave balance.
