# Epic: Payroll & Time Tracking

*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to run the monthly payroll process automatically **so that** employees are paid accurately and on time.
    *   **AC 1:** The system calculates gross pay based on salary or approved time entries.
    *   **AC 2:** The system automatically deducts taxes and benefits.
    *   **AC 3:** I can review and approve the payroll run before payments are processed.

*   **As an Employee,** I want to submit my weekly timesheet for approval **so that** I can be compensated for the hours I've worked.
    *   **AC 1:** I can log hours worked against specific projects or tasks.
    *   **AC 2:** I can submit the timesheet to my manager at the end of the week.
    *   **AC 3:** I receive a notification when my timesheet is approved or rejected.
