# Integration Patterns

## Overview

This document defines how the ERP services integrate with each other to create a unified business system. The integration strategy ensures loose coupling while maintaining data consistency across the enterprise system.

## Integration Architecture Principles

1.  **Event-Driven Communication**: Use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates
2.  **Synchronous APIs**: Use REST APIs for real-time data queries and critical operations
3.  **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its domain data with clear boundaries
4.  **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies for better system resilience
5.  **Compensation Patterns**: Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations
6.  **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: The Financial Management (FIN) module serves as the central hub for all financial transactions.

## HR Service Integration

### Business Context
HR manages the organization's workforce, generating significant financial impacts through payroll, benefits, and employee-related expenses that must be accurately recorded in the financial system.

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Payroll Processing (Event-Driven)

**Pattern**: HR payroll data → FIN journal entries
**Frequency**: Bi-weekly or monthly payroll cycles
**Volume**: High (all employees every pay period)

**Event Schema - Payroll Processed**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "hr.payroll.processed",
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:00:00Z",
  "source": "hr-service",
  "data": {
    "payroll_id": "PAY-2024-003",
    "pay_period_start": "2024-03-01",
    "pay_period_end": "2024-03-15",
    "total_gross_pay": 125000.00
  }
}
```

#### 2. Budget Allocation Queries (API-Based)

**Pattern**: Real-time budget validation for HR decisions
**Use Case**: Hiring approvals, salary increases, training budgets

```http
GET /api/v1/fin/budgets/department/ENG-001?category=SALARY&period=2024-Q1
```

## Supply Chain Management (SCM) Integration

### Business Context
SCM manages procurement, inventory, and vendor relationships, generating accounts payable transactions and inventory valuations that directly impact the balance sheet and cash flow.

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Purchase Order & Invoice Processing (Event-Driven)

**Pattern**: SCM procurement events → FIN AP transactions
**Trigger**: Goods receipt, vendor invoice receipt
**Volume**: High (hundreds of transactions daily)

**Event Schema - Goods Receipt**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "scm.goods.received",
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "purchase_order_id": "PO-2024-001234",
    "vendor_id": "VEN-001",
    "total_amount": 15750.00
  }
}
```

#### 2. Vendor Payment Status Queries (API-Based)

**Pattern**: SCM queries payment status for vendor relationship management

```http
GET /api/v1/fin/ap/vendors/VEN-001/payment-status
```

## Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Integration

### Business Context
CRM manages sales processes and customer relationships, generating accounts receivable transactions and providing revenue data that drives financial performance analysis.

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Sales Order & Revenue Recognition (Event-Driven)

**Pattern**: CRM sales completion → FIN AR invoices and revenue recognition
**Trigger**: Sales order completion, milestone achievement

**Event Schema - Sales Order Completed**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "crm.sales_order.completed",
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T11:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "sales_order_id": "SO-2024-001234",
    "customer_id": "CUS-001",
    "total_amount": 25000.00
  }
}
```

#### 2. Customer Credit Limit Validation (API-Based)

**Pattern**: Real-time credit checks during sales process

```http
GET /api/v1/fin/ar/customers/CUS-001/credit-status
```

## Manufacturing Service Integration

### Business Context
Manufacturing manages production processes, consuming raw materials and producing finished goods, requiring accurate cost accounting and inventory valuation.

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Production Cost Recording (Event-Driven)

**Pattern**: Manufacturing cost events → FIN work-in-progress and inventory updates

**Event Schema - Production Order Completed**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "mfg.production_order.completed",
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T18:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "production_order_id": "PO-MFG-2024-001",
    "product_code": "WIDGET-A",
    "quantity_produced": 1000,
    "total_cost": 45000.00
  }
}
```

## Project Management Service Integration

### Business Context
Project Management tracks time, resources, and costs for client projects, requiring accurate cost accumulation and billing integration with the financial system.

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Time & Expense Recording (Event-Driven)

**Pattern**: Project time and expenses → FIN cost accumulation and billing

**Event Schema - Project Time Logged**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "pm.time.logged",
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T17:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "project_id": "PROJ-CLIENT-A-001",
    "employee_id": "EMP-001",
    "hours": 8.0,
    "billable_amount": 1125.00
  }
}
```

## Integration Error Handling & Resilience

### Error Handling Patterns

- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed events are moved to a DLQ for manual inspection.
- **Retries with Exponential Backoff**: Retry failed operations with increasing delays.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Stop sending requests to a failing service to prevent cascading failures.

### Data Consistency Patterns

- **Eventual Consistency with Compensation**: Use compensating transactions to roll back failed operations.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure that processing the same event multiple times has the same effect as processing it once.

---

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Service Health Dashboards**: Monitor the health of each service and its integrations.
- **Financial Data Integrity Checks**: Regularly verify the integrity of financial data.
- **Event Processing Metrics**: Track event volume, processing latency, and error rates.
