## Overview

This ERP system is designed as a suite of microservices that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for managing a business. Each service is responsible for a specific domain and communicates with other services through a combination of synchronous APIs and asynchronous events.

## Core Modules

- **Financial Management (FIN)**: The central hub for all financial transactions, reporting, and compliance.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Manages the employee lifecycle, payroll, and benefits.
- **Supply Chain Management (SCM)**: Handles procurement, inventory, and vendor relationships.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Manages sales, marketing, and customer interactions.
- **Manufacturing (MFG)**: Controls the production process from raw materials to finished goods.
- **Project Management (PM)**: Tracks projects, resources, and billable hours.
